  13 |     |  * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
  14 |     |  * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
  15 |     |  * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
  16 |     |  *
  17 |     |  * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
  18 |     |  * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
  19 |     |  * to implement supply mechanisms].
  20 |     |  *
  21 |     |  * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
  22 |     |  * this function so it returns a different value.
  23 |     |  *
  24 |     |  * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
  25 |     |  * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
  26 |     |  * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
  27 |     |  * applications.
  28 |     |  *
  29 |     |  * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
  30 |     |  * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
  31 |     |  * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
  32 |     |  * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
  33 |     |  *
  34 |     |  * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
  35 |     |  * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
  36 |     |  * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
